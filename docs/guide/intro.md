# What is Dyn?

Dyn is a dynamically-typed, general-purpose scripting language designed to be ergonomic and easy to use. It allows you to write scripts intuitively, similar to Ruby, Perl, or JavaScript. Thanks to its versatile design, it can be used to build a wide variety of applications, from command-line applications to fully functional web servers.

# What Dyn is NOT?

Although Dyn is a general-purpose language, it might NOT be a good idea to use it in the following cases:

-   Low-level programming, such as for operating systems or embedded systems.
-   Performance-critical applications, such as game engines or media processing.
-   Strongly-typed applications that require dozens of classes and interfaces.
-   Web frontend development.
-   Embedding as a scripting language into other languages.

::: warning

I can NOT guarantee that Dyn will be a suitable choice for the above cases, but you are still welcome to use Dyn for them if you wish.
